Further details on medication, especially when deviating from the study protocol, must be noted in the electronic labbook. Enter a number as `session_id` to uniquely identify this session in case multiple sessions will be run with the same patient and the same medication condition. This cell also initializes a folder structure for this session. A root directory will be created in `C:\\\\Measurements\\\\experiment_name` with subfolders following the BIDS specification. Calibration data recorded via the TMSi GUI and experimental data recorded via Labrecorder will be stored in the sourcedata folder. Folders will only be created if they were not created before."
